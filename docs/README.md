# Introduction

## Project Background&#x20;

BiocryptoID is an innovative identity authentication solution that aims to address the challenges facing current digital identity management. In an increasingly digital world, security, privacy, and convenience have become key requirements for identity authentication. Traditional identity authentication methods often find it difficult to strike a balance between these three aspects. BiocryptoID came into being, combining biometric technology, blockchain distributed identity (DID) and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to provide users with a secure, private and easy-to-use identity management system.



## Project Goal&#x20;

Providing a highly secure biometric registration and verification system Achieve complete control of personal identity information by users Support privacy-preserving identity attribute verification Establish a scalable, interoperable identity management ecosystem



## Business Logic

### Biometric Registration&#x20;

Users provide facial information and some additional real data on the front end, and the project will store this information on AWS

### Biometric Verification&#x20;

Users provide DID + additional security layer password (further ensure the security of DID) + data to be verified (such as age greater than 18 years old) + facial information Within a certain period of time (tentatively set at one week), users do not need to provide facial information, and verification can be completed with DID and security layer password only (reducing exposure risks and further enhancing user privacy security)



## Core Functions

### Biometric Registration&#x20;

Users can register their biometrics through facial recognition technology

### Distributed Identity (DID) Generation

Create a unique decentralized identifier for each user&#x20;

### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verification&#x20;

Allows users to prove identity attributes without revealing specific information&#x20;

### Secure Storage

Using AWS S3 securely stores user biometric data&#x20;

### Flexible zkp verification mechanism

supports custom and third-party verifiers
